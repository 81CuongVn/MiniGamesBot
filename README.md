There are 5 categories in the quiz minigame: General knowledge, Sports, Video Games, Music, Films.

Connect4 and chess take 1 argument, i.e. the second player to play with: ?connect4 [@player2] .

Uno can be played with at most 10 players, tag every player as argument, i.e. ?uno [@player1] ... [@player10]


## Requirements

Check requirements.txt for a list of all the packages that you need.

```
pip install [package]
```


## Ignored files

All private variables, such as discord token and IDs of my own channels and messages, are listed in class called Private in an ignored file private.py . You can replace those with your own IDs.  
Other things that are in ignored are either files needed to update webhooks or that are not mine to make public.
Files and folders you won't need: index.html, assets (for my github pages link)
